# Task 3: 
Building a Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction.

# Objective:
This project aims to develop a Decision Tree Classifier using the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains customer demographic and campaign-related features, with the objective of predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

The following steps were carried out:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Label encoding of categorical features
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Building a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn
- Evaluating the model using confusion matrix and accuracy score
- The implementation used a max depth of 5 for the decision tree, which is a common strategy to avoid overfitting.

# Key findings:
- The model achieved nearly 90% accuracy.
- Categorical features were encoded properly, ensuring compatibility with the decision tree model.
- Basic evaluation metrics (accuracy and confusion matrix) were included and interpreted.
